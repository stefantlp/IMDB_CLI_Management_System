# IMDB_CLI_Management_System

This repository contains a command-line application developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in the second semester of the second year of my studies at university. The project simulates a simple version of the IMDB platform, managing information related to movies, actors, TV shows, and more.
